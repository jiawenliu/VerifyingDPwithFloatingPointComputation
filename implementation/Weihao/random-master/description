Description: This contribution is a modelisation of random programs 
as measures in Coq. It started in 2004 in the context 
of the AVERROES project (http://www-verimag.imag.fr/AVERROES/). 
It is based on comon work with Philippe Audebaud (ENS Lyon).
It was last updated in february 2007.

It contains the following elements 
  - an axiomatisation of the interval [0,1] and derived properties
(files Ubase.v and Uprop.v);

  - a definition of measures on a type A as functions of type
(A->[0,1])->[0,1] enjoying special stability properties (files
Monads.v and Probas.v); proofs that these constructions have a
monadic structure;

  - an interpretation of programs of type A as measures, in particular
a fixpoint construction; the definition of an axiomatic semantic for
deriving judgements such as ``the probability of an expression e to
evaluate to a result satisfying property q belongs to an interval [p,q]'' 
(file Prog.v);

  - Proof of probabilistic termination of a linear random walk (file
Iterflip.v);

  - Proof of a program implementing a bernoulli distribution
(Proba(bernouilli(p)=true)=p) using a coin flip and the derived binomial 
law (Proba(binomial p n=k)=C(n,k)p^k(1-p)^{n-k}) (file Bernoulli.v);

  - Proof of estimation of the combination of two random executions
(file Choice.v)

  - Proof of partial termination of parameterized random walk (file Ycart.v)

  - Definition of a measure on traces from a mesure on transitions
steps (file Nelist.v, Transitions.v) 

The document random.pdf contains a short introduction to the library
associated to the Gallina source code of the library.
